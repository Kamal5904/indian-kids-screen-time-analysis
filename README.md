# 📊 Indian Kids Screen Time Analysis  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project analyzes the **screen time habits of Indian kids** based on factors such as **urban vs rural lifestyle, devices used, and health impacts**.  
The goal is to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and extract meaningful insights.

## ⚙️ Dataset  
- **File name:** `Indian_Kids_Screen_Time.csv`  
- **Columns include:**  
  - `Age` → Age of child  
  - `Gender` → Male/Female  
  - `Urban_or_Rural` → Living environment  
  - `Primary_Device` → Device used most  
  - `Avg_Daily_Screen_Time_hr` → Daily screen time (hours)  
  - `Health_Impacts` → Issues (eye strain, sleep disturbance, etc.)  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- Python 🐍  
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`  

---

## 📊 EDA Workflow  
1. Data loading & inspection  
2. Data cleaning (missing values, duplicates, outliers)  
3. Univariate analysis (screen time, devices, demographics)  
4. Bivariate analysis (Urban vs Rural, gender vs devices)  
5. Visualization with Seaborn/Matplotlib  
6. Insights & key findings  

---

## ✅ Key Findings  
- Urban kids generally spend **more screen time** than rural kids.  
- **Mobile phones** are the most used devices.  
- High screen time is linked to **eye strain and sleep issues**.
